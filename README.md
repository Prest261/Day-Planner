# Day-Planner
## Description
This is a web-based application that is a day planner, consisting of time slots from 9am to 5pm. This day planner contains an input field for the user to type in reminders or appointments that will be saved once they hit the save button. The planner also is color coded based on past, present or future. The past shows the time slots colored grey, the present shows the time slots red, and the future shows them green. That way the user can tell what has easily passed and what they have coming up, at a glance.  

## Usage
This application is meant to be a simple day planner for users to keep track of their day. This day planner allows employees to see their day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity.
